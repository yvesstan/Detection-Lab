As i practice pcaps, i found out a way to make it more easier and relevant on which procedure to take first. I like to check for conversations IPv4 sort the bytes same thing with TCP and UDP. I immediately got interested with IP address of 192.168.1.216 and 2.56.57.108 because they have the most bytes even in Endpoints.
